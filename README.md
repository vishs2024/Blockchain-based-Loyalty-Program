# Blockchain-Based Loyalty Program

A decentralized **loyalty rewards platform** that leverages blockchain technology to provide **transparency, security, and trust** between businesses and customers. Instead of relying on centralized systems, loyalty points are issued as **blockchain tokens**, enabling customers to **earn, redeem, and transfer rewards** securely and seamlessly.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Smart Contract Powered** â€“ Automates loyalty point issuance, redemption, and validation using Solidity.
- **Secure & Transparent** â€“ All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring fraud prevention and verifiable histories.
- **User-Friendly Interface** â€“ Responsive React-based frontend for smooth interaction.
- **Role-Based Access** â€“ Admins (businesses) can issue points, customers can redeem them.
- **Local & Test Network Support** â€“ Works with Ganache for local testing and deployable to Ethereum testnets.

- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) (GUI or CLI version for local blockchain)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome / Brave recommended)

**Optional but Recommended**
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Solidity and JavaScript/TypeScript extensions
