Blockchain-Based Loyalty Program
This project is a decentralized loyalty rewards platform that leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and trust between businesses and customers. Instead of relying on traditional, centralized reward systems, this platform issues tokenized loyalty points on the blockchain, enabling seamless earning, redemption, and transfer of rewards.

Key Features
Smart Contract Powered – Built using Solidity smart contracts to automate loyalty point issuance, redemption, and validation.

Transparency & Trust – Transactions are stored on the blockchain, preventing fraud and ensuring verifiable reward histories.

User-Friendly Interface – A responsive React-based web interface for customers and administrators to interact with the system easily.

Multi-Role Access – Supports both admin (business) functions like creating rewards and user (customer) functions like redeeming them.

Local & Test Network Ready – Compatible with Ganache for local testing and deployment to Ethereum testnets.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap

Backend: Node.js / Express.js

Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity, Truffle, Ganache, MetaMask

Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Truffle migrations (smart contracts)

How It Works
Businesses (Admins) create and assign loyalty points to customers via the web interface.

Customers earn and redeem points through blockchain-verified transactions.

All operations are immutable and publicly verifiable on the blockchain ledger.
